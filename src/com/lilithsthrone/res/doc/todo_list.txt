	Other:
		Added: Ability to remove jinxes from any NPC's clothing.
		Added: Breeder collar (feminine, neck slot). Can be bought from Nyan's 'Specials' menu.

		Enabled futanari as a minimal gender encounter by default.

		Fixed game freeze/crash when trying to remove your offspring.

		Character import now correctly loads in your surname.
		Fixed no_clothing_covering_nipples error that was appearing in some sex actions.
		Fixed nipples being described as "dry".
		Typo fixes.

		Succubi in the Dark Alleyway tiles will no longer disappear as soon as you move away.
		Feeding your prostitute daughter a Vixen's Virility pill will now correctly override her promiscuity pill's effects.

		Fixed random encounters of certain genders when they were supposed to be turned off.
		Prostitute offspring will no longer resist after you've paid to have sex with them.

		Fixed slave room description not taking into account bed upgrades.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	 add 'spit lubrication' actions for all orifices as a replacement for the finger sucking
	
	I will definitely add options for offspring to willingly be enslaved later on. :3

And I will get submissive sex with your offspring added for the next release! :3
	
	you know you can't hover over effects in the slave management
	
	harem gauze
	
	 I could only tease anal, and then it let me tease pussy, and then I could penetrate
	 
	When you are the submissive partner during sex, you are still given the option to pull out when you orgasm even when there's nothing to pull out from.

	NPCs seem to almost exclusively prioritize playing with their breasts
	
	lust seems to build up crazy fast
	
	submissive sex with slaves
	
	i submitted to a wolf boy, he said he wanted to turn me into his wolf girl, and then decided i dont need a pussy?
		("wolf-girl" first of all, then "shemale wolf-morph")
	
	offspring were androphiles and I was playing as masculine. One was actually into it, but then later was grossed out. Seemed weird.
	
	NPC multi-orgasm
	Pregnancy/Impreg, and Cum Stud/Addict fetishes have a chance to make the NPC decide to go for a second(or third!) round after their orgasm. 
	
	If you climax inside and potentially get a NPC pregnant but then remove the character, they stay on the pregnancy stats screen forever without making any progress.
	 Got a character here that it says is certainly pregnant but it's been saying that for weeks in-game after I removed her.
	
		debug:
		1: 'pacify harpies', which essentially completes the harpy matriarch quest for you.
		2: Trigger arcane storm
	
	
	
	-----------------
	
	Finish character creation
		I need to finish the backgrounds, add in sex experience stuff, then add in an opportunity to have sex with the random NPC, then integrate the end of the character creator into the rest of the prologue
		
		shrug it off an approach the crowd, where a guy/girl approaches you and starts talking [background, xp points]
		
		the strange atmosphere seems to be growing in intensity, and you suddenly find yourself talking about sex [sex background, sex exp]
		
		React differently based on if you're virgin, "normal" or slut, start heading towards the museum bathroom
		Get stopped by Lily, she's panicking about Arthur (partner sighs and says they'll find you later).
	
		hoodies
	
	
	Add more ways to influence affection and obedience.
		take for walks
		punish
		talk
		hug
		kiss
	Sex with slaves for some reason when you end it you collapse and they walk away after doming you.
		
	CUM EFFECTS
	
	-----------------
		
		
		talk our kids into taking another name. Or just make the decision for them
		
		Incest Content still says Not Implemented when selecting the fetish.
		
		
		orgasm denial
		rimming
		
	Condoms:
		track cum
		inseminate action
			Filled condoms keep track of the type of cum that they're holding, and can now be used to artificially inseminate characters.
			The offspring of any resulting pregnancy will have traits based on the the cum's stored body values.
			E.g. Obtaining a filled condom from a dog-boy, and then transforming him into a cat-girl, then impregnating her with the filled condom, will result in offspring inheriting traits from her old dog-boy body, as well as her new cat-girl one.
		
	* all the slave equipment you buy is jinxed and you can neither unjinx (because it only shows selection options for your own jinxed equipment) nor otherwise take it off your slaves.
		Condense essences into just arcane essences
		Use essences to unjinx something
	
	Add self-doggy actions to SubDoggy and DomDoggy
	
	exhibitionist fetish should give some penalties for being covered up
	
	busty boys not working
	Neuter Androgynous have breasts
	: I think anything that requires breasts won't be working
	
	personality for named NPCs
	
	are content toggle settings supposed to influence the fetishes NPCs can spawn with?
		Cause they currently don't seem to do so and it seems like they should. IE non con and incest fetishes probably shouldnt be in the NPC spawn list if those fetishes are toggled off.
	
	And you can't change your surname in the city hall
	
	
	Add items used to event log
	
	inverted nipples
	
	spiked and messy hair
	
	Gate getPlayerVaginaVirginityLossDescription() descriptions behind masochist/virginity fetishes
	
	Limit NPC hair styles based on maximum length
	
	Reduce number of children
	Pregnancy rework to take into account safe days
	
	Save items
	
	Save NPCs
	
	
	Full screen
	
	Even if you have thin or normal lips, most of the sex actions describe them as plump or full.
	
	[Need to make it so if there's only one partner, possibility is certain]
		And the game's not recognizing that my character is already preggo. It still shows only as High probabillity
	
	

	Also some of the clothing has to be manually removed by going into inventory as the npc's or you cant do it themselves mostly seems to affect undies layer clothing
	
	Selling the magic gems and feathers, you cant sell them some times sell all sell one nothing happens and they stay in inventory
	
	more cum-covered status effects, as well as cum-inflation scenes.
	
	I would love to take slaves out on a leash, even if its just to get their makeup/hair done.
	
	-bug: this is kind of funny, but you can use an elixir to remove your vagina while you have something in it (as in- by drinking the potion during sex),
		 which does not stop the penetration (though it does make the game reference what I assume to be an empty string, because description text is still printed but with the word for the pussy missing).
		  You might even be able to get pregnant from it, though I haven't managed to pull that off (I got the "might be pregnant" box to appear, but the 5 times I tried it I didn't get knocked up).
	
	Can unequip Rose's clothing in sex
	
	Add makeup wipes
	Add nailpolish remover
	Add freckles
	lipstick: different colored bottom and top lips
	
	a pink slave collar that increased fertility
		glowing pink
	
	post sex NPC inventory interaction still on the to do list
	
	
	It worked once but now for some unknown reason enchanting is no longer working at all
	
	NPCs not listening to requests (Brax always anal)
	
	Ralph does nothing if ask for discount too early x_x
	Okay he did it after blowing him to at least 30
	maybe the if statement that displays the 'big discount' button is borked? Or maybe it doesnt have one. At any rate it should only pop up when it'll actually succeed/do something
	
	hotdogging & intercrural
	
	I'll be adding more orgasm options (including NPC using ass/pussy-to-mouth) both this and next week! :3

	And I'm also planning on expanding those harpy punishment scenes to be a little longer and more interactive in the future. ^^
	
	I'll also add that condom-force-feeding action for NPCs at some point soon, thanks for the suggestion!
	
	
	I dropped stolen panties (with almost full inventiory) and game just closed. Fucking hell.
	
	Despite putting in the settings, a 0-spawn rate for males, when I come across my kids in alleyways, most of them appear as males.
	
	I was considering using stamina in sex to determine for how long you can keep on going (with the option to drink stamina restoration potions for those that want to get to 60 orgasms).
	 disassociate the state of your hymen from your virginity, so that once you've lost it, you can never be a true virgin again
	
	fingers in partner's mouth, and tongue actions
	
	when I imported my old character, it reset all the gender preferences to a strange selection like 100% towards male characters and 100% towards futanari, with everything else 0%.
	
	
	
	 Also, I wound up with 2 of Brittany's lollipop after fighting her, doing nothing, then having sex. 
	
	
	Combine gender prefs and pronouns
	
	turning off shemale encounters in "gender preferences" tab - doesn't prevent them from appearing in game
	
	
	
	could you make some "lore" explanation for protagonist's ability to use arcane energy for chosing fetishes
	
	
	Oh wanted to ask, have you ever got around to changing the description of the virginity and lusty maiden perks? While she doesn't want to ever lose it, she has nothing wrong with using her pussy to seduce, tease and drive her friends/foes with lust ;D Cock tease and spreads come to mind.

	Also, any follow ups on already exposed states pre combat/sex? Being an exhibitionist virtually removes all npc reactions from the game, which is wierd!
	
	
	Forced TF:
	-Height: very often go below 5 feet, is there that many who like midgets?:P
	-hair:...or repunzels? Very often get floor length hair and never anything less then backlength. Figure common values should be shoulder to back length, with others being outliers.
	-Breasts: Never target below c cup, and even in non breastfetish/cowmorph scenarios often get DD+. I'm figuring common values should be B-C and even A be allowed.
	-Cow morphs: Get if they desire female and your male they will continue to try to transform horns with no luck. Also, should 4 titted teats on breasts and/or udders be a tf possibility?
	-I think with forced tf on and/or tf fetish, if you aren't the desired gender of npc they should transform you when you are defeated rather than just robbing you.
	-I'm wondering if there is a way to fine tune color combinations that happen. I understand this is hard with a random system, but fairly often you get unatural combinations or something that would make a color coordinator cry. IE: Blond fur, ginger hair, brown eyes. Perhaps have some "presets" that you have a medium chance of being assigned?
	
	
	Add cloaca TF
	
	Add fisting
	
	
	Offspring:
		I'll make sure to add in unique dialogue for if you're keeping their other parent a slave as well.
	
	
	Add pecs as flat-chest quivalent to breasts
	Posing fetish for when you love showing off, Muscle worship fetish for when you love admiring. Each would be weak to the opposite's associated tease.
	Could unlock some muscle worship sex scenes too.
	
	
	while unzipping them gives access to your genitals, it doesn't actually let you shift aside your undergarments to allow access to them. 
	shifting aside clothing can only be done when you have access to the groin slot on a character, which creates some problems when you can gain access to the penis or vagina slot without also gaining access to the groin slot at the same time.
	
	
	fix finger sucking
	
	udders & crotch breasts
	
	
	------------
	
	
	
	
	- Backalley neutral:
		- Vending machine (lesser TF items)
		DONE Package (package is still wrapped but the label has been soaked in cum, can't read it)

	I've enslaved a succubus but there's no 'grow cock' action during sex (as with Lilaya), has something to do with affection or obedience level
	
	NPC TF fetish to TF race
	
	bimbo lollipop TF pubes don't match
	
	hide undergarments
	
	colour presets based on ethnicity
	
	So my character is a dom... huge build, huge cock, huge balls, etc. I'm taking off my clothes to a female, no penis or anything...
		"She lets out a patronizing 'aww' as your huge cock is revealed. "Look at that cute little thing!""
	
	Pure virgins, when defeated, should have their first sex scene be automatically marked as a non-con scene if non-con scenes are enabled
		
	jinxed clothing on slaves to remove
	
	Lilaya, Kate, Ralph, sex update
	
	temp NPC level scaling
	
	taking self-virginity desriptions
	
	Minor Bug report
	When I started the latest version I exported my character from the older version and did a start (import)
	This retained that my character was pregnant, and when it came time to give birth, nothing happened, the status was removed, my phone said I had never been pregnant before
	Also (probably not a bug)
	I bought Scarlett and while being raped they refuse to use elixirs/potions. Using Slave Management/Inventory then no problems, they take them fine.
	
	
	giving greater demon tfs being able to transform
	
	>referred to as a horse-girl just because my character has a horse penis
	
	Lilaya she never asked my character to pull out, but she latter acted as if she had
	
	The denial options need to work in submissive stance, I think
	Although with different text
	Also still seeing inconsistencies in attraction logic
	Encounter offspring; says they're attracted
	But when you talk to them, it says they're not
	
	
	what do you think about having orgasms affect NPC affection/ obedience? IE consensual sex orgasms could increase affection.
		Meanwhile non con orgasms increase obedience (And if they have the non con fetish then non con orgasms also raise affection.)
	
	improve forced transformation descriptions
	
	incest encounter offspring, sex option do not appear if incest off
		incest fetish increases encounter rate
	
	moving the chastity cage into the new 'penis' inventory slot, so that problem should be resolved by the next version
	isBlocksFromSight
	
	Body description for girl cum
	
	
	Make Ralph greater horse-boy
	
	Stretched out instantly in sex? (it only takes one thrust?)
	
	AI:
	
	FINGERS IN MOUTH
	Had a naizuri scene freeze at 100% after asking the npc to "pull out", had to break out of the scene with the debug code.
		scene got stuck with the NPC "doing nothing" every turn no matter what I did, never got to the orgasm scene.
	Ralph needs own AI
	
	
	
	Gynephilic females will not transform you. Each and every time there is a gynephilic female, they will be criminals for enslavement.
	 The only time I was able to get a transformation was during the arcane storm. Also, no female transformations, just "cuntboy" and "hermaphrodite."
	
	
	Is there any way to make all breast have equal size? If you make more than one pair of breast, the lower ones are always smaller and I would like some way to have all breast have the same cup size.
	
	
	
	
	equip collar from within their inv

	consumable targets (mothers milk)
	
	 I think the code for selecting items needs to be refined, theres a decent hang whenever i select an item and also a slightly smaller one whenever i try to sell/move/use one
 
	 add another effect if someone with a pure virginity fetish loses it to someone they have high affection with
	 
	Add wait button
	
	Make mother's milk work instantly
	
	 fight them to regain the flames and items they stole
When you defeat them you will get the option to "reclaim" giving you back only items that they took
	
	Scarletts transfer buttons not working (in .exe???)
	
	in buyback if you sold a shit load of essence. It takes up a slot individually. Example being I sold 70 of them it ended up like being 1 in each slot of buyback
	
	the three harpy items names dont appear right in the item present box when you store them ([harpy.name] in right panel)
	
	saliva
	
	making the NPCs forcibly transform you even if they aren't attracted to you soon
	
	Enslaving a free-spirited person should probably damage their opinion of you
	
	Add lube item
	
	arousal bars have frozen
	After continuing It still reached the next orgasm, it looks like it just didn't display arousal
	
	rape affection changes
	
	Can't sell enslaved offspring???
	
	Alexa's shop has a small display bug, if you don't have enough money to buy from her it'll display the Sell prices of her slaves on a greyed out button. It's a minor problem given how lucrative slaving is right now, of course.
	
	Scarlett room transfer issues
	So, I'm trying to move Scarlett into one of the slave rooms, but "Transfer Here" isn't actually doing anything on her. When I try to click "Detailed Management", it also does nothing.
	
	
	the Frustrated effect should be removed by orgasm in later sex
	
	Seems to be an order of operations issue, probably on my end... Stripped a criminal, stole her clothes, had sex, before sex scene ended put on the collar, and when I went to pick her up she had an inventory full of clothes... Only time I've had that happen...  I just started collaring them before sexing them to prevent it...
	
	It appears that in this release, Succubi will disappear from the dark alleyway they were encountered in the moment you leave the tile, regardless of your choices.
	
	Thigh sex and hotdogging
	
	Forced jinxed clothing
	
	It no longer shows pc or npc's wearing condoms on the penis slot
	
	Add clothing preview to debug
	
	status effect for stuffed with toys
	
	tongue length in stats page
	
	Chinese dress (feminine, torso and legs slot), and hair bun covers (head slot, exists in single and double version)
	Japanese Loose Socks
	
	Split forced TF content into sexual dn racial
	
	feedback on the edited Ashley's shop I sent you weeks ago, just to see if my editing has improved
	
	Add tracking of who you had sex with.
	
	The issue with NPCs removing bras might be related to the Maid set. It only seems to happen when I have that set equipped
	
	Non con fetishist NPCs don't seem to rape you...
		They had the right orientation
		They put up a resistance and make you rape them if you win even if they have an orientation that likes you. But that makes sense cause of thier fetish they want to be raped/ struggle during sex.
			But As it is currently they don't seem to be willing to be on the dominant end of a rape scense which contradicts the fetishes's current description text.
			It might perhaps be a good idea to split up the Non con fetish anyways though. Into giving and recieving versions.
	
	the dialogue boxes are not automatically scrolling to the bottom anymore
	This is sex scene dialogue, it won't scroll down automatically when a new message appears
	 sometimes scrolls down, and sometimes doesn't
	
	There seems to be a bug with scrolling on the main screen during large scenes.  Intermittently it will not scroll to new text.  EDIT: This may have been confusion over especially long text sequences.  I have not had any issues for awhile now
	Hmm, the default screen width isn't enough to make the +/- buttons work right on the level-up screen
	
	Because hands are not tracked separately, fluids can travel from one hand to the other in unexpected ways.  If a partner fingers your ass, then somehow lubricates their other fingers while still fingering you, your ass will also become lubricated
	
	Forgot to ping you earlier and editing it in doesn't help but giving an NPC the collar then equipping it to them doesn't make them your slave. Probably would have liked that before the release but yeah I have memory that looks worse than swiss cheese
	
	The AI seems to be fixating on chest-play when in the kneeling position for some reason.  Oral and oral performers are more into paizuri/naizuri than breast and breast lovers.  There is possibly also too much of a focus on anal fingering, but this may be due to a lack of other options
	
	in the characters present screen if you mouse over the closing the NPC is wearing it only shows you what slot it is not what the item is
	
	Scarlett refuses to take a vixen's virility. I don't think slaves should get to do that
	
	Also, she's still replacing her maid's dress
	I  gave Scarlett a maid dress and had sex with her, when I checked her inventory she was back in the clothes she had when she owned the slave shop
	
	
	
	Remove jinxed clothing from slave
	
	restore the option to acces an NPC's inventory right after sex
	
	Also I think I pinned it down with that odd feeling. The map doesn't seem to have border, infact almost nothing seems to except the button panel and the event log.
	
	Sometimes NPCs will ignore an article of clothing during a scene. NPCs seem to not like removing my character's bra for whatever reason.

	 Alright so it seems like we can give NPC's clothes and they seem to keep wearing them even when you leave and return.
	  They only seem to equip new clothes if you have sex and  by the end of it they have a major slot thats empty.
	   As much as i hate to say it though unless the NPC is an exhibitionist they should probably try to change out of exposing clothing unless it's jinxed

		 "You love loosing yourself and giving in to your womb's deisre for fresh seed~ The feeling of being fucked while being at your most fertile drives you insane with lust"~ :3
	Impregnation fetish should also probably be the strength/weekness to it~ where as a tease from either of them will break the other~

	#################
	
	the ongoing penetration status effects only affect the one that's penetrated
	no ongoing status for breasts as well, so I don't think anyone's gaining any arousal for ongoing paizuri
	
	foreskin
	
	add a 'request TF' action in the post-victory screen
	
	balance Kate's prices and add confirmation
	
	Make harpies a rare dominion alley encounter, it is odd that they're currently singled out as never showing up there when they live on top of the buildings
	
	I played 0.1.84.1 for a few hours last night, and the longer I played, the more lag I noticed. Ending post-combat sex scenes brought out the worst of it, with the game freezing up for 10--30 seconds or so right after hitting the Stop Sex button
	
	import's still borked
		The color of the hair on my head changed, my dick became prehensile, my cum became slimy and oily, and if I'm in danger of pregnant during import I lose my vagina
	
	convert handjobs to ongoing acts
	
	bell gag and bell collar
	
	Liquid basic encahntment allow +/- potency
	Lactation base transformation (small increase in lactation) is duplicated in breasts, which also increase lactation (wetness).
	
	Did Lilaya's tests twice, Essences quest didn't unlock
	
	Make Brax/harpy forced TFs an option in the scene
	
	pubic hair spawns
	NPC spawn with extra hair pls
	
	turn the negative clothing status effect into an arousal gain one
	
	So the harpy matriarchs are initially missing some positions such as Back to Wall, but those positions com back immediately when I move into a different position.
	
	Also think I ran into a bug where I was having non-con with an impregnation fetish male, and I asked him to pull out and the game had him pull out but stay at 100 orgasm and whatever option I hit just had him respond with "the man is waiting"
	 or something along those lines
	
	Forced TF isn't good for human-only playthroughs
	
	I'll add in a preferences screen for the forced TF content as soon as I can, to allow you to define the limits of what you're comfortable being transformed into. ^^
	
	Both with TF fetish -> all in one
	
	I'll add a way to submit to forced TFs after a combat victory, thanks for the suggestion. ^^

	I'll also add some correct virginity-loss descriptions for self-actions. ^^
	
	add in say innerlocking figures as a continuous activited during sex to turn people with it on~/also prevent them from doing things with their hands
	
	the middle 4 locations could always include the house, shopping district, and tower. Then define locations as N/S/E/W
	
	whenever I beat cow-morphs everything freezes (when entering sex scene) (both were broodmothers)
	
	slots for extra arms if you have more then one set
	
	Add 'penetration-type' requests (request to fuck them, or to have paizuri)
	
	Add udders
	
	You can't learn partner's ass virginity by removing her clothes. You only discover it by performing anal
	
	They both lead to default no penetration orgasm texts.
		That's probably because there's no dick or breast statuses.
	
	flared & tapered make mutually exclusive
	
	Fluid falvours and addiction

	Also, right now, everyone has a species-preference. -may- want to make it so that some folk don't care much about species and only about body-shape/sex
	Make gender preferences for NPC's forced TFs settable
	
	Add paizuri for multi-breasts
	
	Maybe a non-furry version of forced TF would change the character's body type and such. For example, changing femininity, breast size, etc.
	I think bimbofication and sissification are common, fur-free, fetishes on TFgamessite. So maybe the human-only forced TFs could do something like that?
	
	Now, one other thought, maybe have fetishes figure in a little bit for what gear they end up with?
		Not for normal peps, but when deciding whether to be a herm or off-gender sex.
		If someone has a cum feitsh or receiving cock feitsh, they should probably prefer a partner with a cock.
		If they have impregnation fetishes, it would make sense for them to prefer a partner with a vagina.
		This could actually be tested after the random roll has been done, and adjusts the result then.
		That will save a fair bit of coding work.

	If a character has the non-consent fetish, you should remove the arousal gain penalty from resisting sex. You might even gain extra arousal
	NPCs with the non-con fetish always resist
	So a sadistic character will gain more arousal from a resisting partner and a non-con fetishist would gain extra arousal while resisting instead of having a penalty.
	
	Firstly, you could change the description of the Non-con fetish to only include being raped, but not necessarily raping others. 
	Then, you can expand the sadism fetish to include raping others. Alternatively, you could also make a second red boardered "dominant" version of the Non-con fetish.
	Also, you could have the "resist" action only decrease the character's arousal if they don't have the noncon fetish. I have no idea where this is done in the code however but if you can find where to stick it, a little if statement would probably do

	The overlay display properly stretches for an item that blocks your clothing, but it doesn't properly stretch for item effects that are large - talked with @Innoxia about this and apparently fixing this is hell.
	-- Proficiency "spell cost reduction"
	-- Seduction "willpower damage"
	
	Sell All "Sell all of your tiara for x" improper pluralizing (this does work for items?)
	-- Buy All "Buy all of the opaque demonstone" also has improper pluralizing
	-- Drink All too
	-- Store All too
	-- Take All too
	
	Text misaligned when unequip drop warning is saved
	
	Possible bug with identifying working with stacks instead of single items (confirming that there is a bug here would be real nice because then I could fix it)
	
	Known possible inventory related improvements which I haven't applied yet because... ehhh lemme know if you want these:
	
	The bottom border of the item overlay with effects grows as the effects list goes on, this could get normalized
	Buy back says "Vendor will sell it to you for $ x.", could be "Vendor will let you buy it back for $ x."
	Dyeing items prints the text below the shop dialogue, when buying and selling items prints the text under the shop dialogue
	Known issues related to inventory that I'm not gonna fix:
	
	Pluralization bugs
	-- "You hand over all of your A dye-brush to Ralph in exchange for ¤ 287." Yeahhh that's item names and pluralization hell
	
	
	Flavour text in-game says it is custom to kiss a slave for one last time before enslavement, since kissing a slave is considered taboo
	
	Bugs
	
	Gym/Fast food
	
	After defeating my character, the succubi just finger their nipples and tail-fuck themselves to completion a lot of the time. Is there a way to disable this?
	
	Hey, tailpegging is super broken, it doesn't properly check to see if the player actually has a tail.
	
	The only bug i have found is when you use transformative enchantments on multiple (maybe single, haven't tested) breasts, specifically trying to grow the nipple and areola size that it keeps switching between 'getting larger' and 'shrinking' when all were enchanted to be Major Boost
	
	Cam inside of kate knocking her up. Then right after the sex ended had sex again cumming inside her and when I checked the pregnancy stats found she had 2 ongoing pregnancys at the same time
	
	Having an issue where using a cock-growing elixir gives me a penis with the wrong skin color. In my instance, my pale character grew a brown penis.
	
	
	Genderless mound" on dolls should probably be, "sexless mound".  Genitals don't really have a gender, so to speak, and another word for genitals is sex.(edited)
[23:01] DarkMaster: That mound being exposed does not trigger the exposed condition, may not be a bug but exposing it would still be public indecency and perhaps embracing
	
	I encountered a possible bug... I asked Ralph for the big discount, and now every move he does... is a lack thereof. he won't move at all. if it helps pin down the bug, it's durring a storm, and I already have a 25% discount. I don't know if either of those have to do with this.

hypnotic cum

add in part-specific colouring

Not sure if it's been pointed out but when I choose "slut" as a starting choice, it doesn't work. In fact, if I choose it, go back, and choose another (e.g average), I end up with a mix between slut and whatever other I chose!

1. The latest preview did not find my exported character from 1.83 but from the HF
2. The hair/skin/eye colors got changed all to brown, possibly due to color change in code
3. Testicles changed from vestigal to average
4. Cum amt changed from an extreme amount to average
5. My demonic ears lost their color. Were Lilac, now color isn't being mentioned

once you've selected to have glowing eyes, if you were to cycle back to regular the selected text doesn't shift to regular

	NPC's with broodmother fetish do not try to get pregnant. This has also something to do with the first problem I've mentioned.

	
	New perk: Tempered (below arcane mastery). When willpower drops to 0 the first time, it stays at 1 instead.
New perk: Marathon (below cardio queen). When stamina drops to 0 the first time, it stays at 1 instead.
Change perk: "indefatigable" to "hulk", when health drops to 0 the first time, it stays at 1 instead.
	
	New status effect: Tired. Caused by being awake for over 12 hours in a row, gives no debuffs but in 4 hours it will become the status effect "exhausted". New status effect: Exhausted. Caused by being tired for 4 hours (ie awake for over 16 hours in a row), gives -5 strength -5 stamina and -5 willpower. Also make rest take 8 instead of 4 hours (succubi need to sleep too!).
	
	Minor bug report: Gaining more testicles seems to be bugged. I created a potion to take a character from 2 to 8, and I got this message 3 times:"A tingling feeling spreads down into your testicles, and you let out a little cry as you feel some of them shrinking away and disappearing.

4) New fetish: Chastity fetish. Frustrated debuff (-10 spell damage -50 willpower resist) becomes chaste (+50 stamina, -25 willpower resist)

You could make a new file full of "clothing tag" enums. The tags would describe clothes. For example, "revealing", "protective", "modest", "bondage" etc. Each item could have multiple tags. When the enchantment on the item is randomly generated, the tags would influence what types of enchantments are randomly selected.

You could do different things with this system: 
- maybe certain enchantments are only available for items with the right tags. 
(eg: revealing clothes like miniskirts might be the only ones to give a bonus to willpower damage.)

- maybe certain enchantments might be impossible for items with the wrong tags.
(eg: revealing clothes might never give bonuses to physical damage resistance.)

- maybe enchantments are still randomly generated but if a piece of clothing has a certain tag it might automatically get a stronger bonus. 
(eg: a physical damage resistance enchant on protective clothing would give a much higher bonus than a physical damage resistance enchant on revealing clothing.)



After a few moments, you're left with eight balls."
When it should be an indication that I'm gaining testicles, and the three messages should have given different amounts (first should have said 4, second 6, third 8).

	Hmm. Being pushed down into submissive cowgirl by a gynephilic victor that believes you to be female seems like it is probably not intended behavior?
	
	Also, there seems to be a continuity issue with NPCs' fetishes and their physical traits, such as a large number of girls I'm running into that like giving anal despite not actually having a penis themselves or guys who like being impregnated.
	
	my characters completely dry asshole is now being lubricated for some reason despite it being dry. It also only shows up when arousal is above 80
	
	1. The foot revamp where you have three foot styles (Talon, Foot/paw, Hoof) which is then used to figure blocked feet for clothing.
	 2. cloaca descriptions so that any avian/reptiles are given proper descriptions, as they look doll-like most of the time. 
	
	
	-Default to a different hair colour than white.
	-Body hair should default to the same colour as head hair, with a setting that specifically says, "Same as hair".
	  Once the game starts, then it makes sense to have that be set to a normal hair colour for transformation effects.  If it isn't already, body hair colour should probably also be fur colour.
	[21:41] DarkMaster: .
	Fetish suggestions: 
	-If a specific content type is completely disabled (like incest and non-con), then that fetish should not appear on the fetish screen at all and characters should not spawn with that fetish.
	-Content types that are partially disabled (like forced TFs) should either prevent the PC from being able to take those kinks, or prevent random NPCs from spawning with them, depending on what part is actually disabled.
	-Additionally/alternatively, enabling specific content partially unlocks that content (such as allowing the Lilaya scene and Brax's forced TF) but taking the fetish makes the content more likely (kids spawning in alleys and random NPCs TFing the player).
	
	
	Equals and HashCode *should* be ok for Abstract Clothing, Item, and Weapon types, but maybe make sure.
	
	GATE HAIR PROPERLY FOR TFS
	
	Gate obesity
	
	Add facesitting position, with descriptions from SABracSubCowgirl
	
	Good point, I'll add fuckable nipples (and urethras) behind option gates.
	
	so apparently if you're sitting on Brax's face when he cums, the system thinks that you were sitting on his dick
		just confirmed it does the same thing with vaginal
		doesn't count as penetration for the sake of virginity though, as my character is a """pure""" virgin and did not get broken by it
	
	exhibitionist clothing equipping
	
	remove all clothing button? or a strip button?
	
	So apparently if you import a character over from a new version and go through the prologue, then knock up Lilaya in the first encounter it won't progress since it ends differently.
		Going in for tests again lets you bone irregardless, but it won't let you do other sidequests that involve her, or progress the story along. I take it there's a catch missing, or that knocking her up isn't fully implemented?
	
	Also she stood there behind me sucking on her tail the whole time and did not even fuck me it was like finger sucking all over again

	(I think I fixed, but check)
	Seems to be a bug where the second time a character gives birth the "pass out" button (and its knocked out equivalent) doesnt progress the scene, leaving you stuck there.
	
	a crash bug, if in you'r room, you put objects, and have to much objects, if you take all and don't have engout space in your invotory, the game crash
	
	 I think something's up with gender pronouns in the latest hotfix. Either that or traps are no longer called traps and are just called "Man" regardless of settings or feminity level.
	  Not sure, I'm out of town so haven't really been able to give this release a good stress test, hence why I'm not even signed in.

	Maybe the change to starting body breast size for androgynous males did that since they no start with a flat chest?
	 Either way, manually modifying the custom pronouns for players seems to change nothing, which might be a bigger problem if it's just not working at all like it should. Just FYI.
	
	found a bug that happens when you get pregnant from brax and then feminize him you get stuck in delivering scene
		it actually gets stuck because father is bree/brandi: Stanley Brandisson (horse-morph) Father:Brandi Mother:Carlos
	
	you fixed the player getting the more severe arcane storm effect but now while the player is outside it does not give any indicator that the arcane storm is happening at all in the status screen, although it does show you arcane storm protected status while indoors
	
	It appears that the chasing squirrels book is still on the drop table for random encounters even if you have already read it
	
	it seems dying items acts etremely oddly with stacks
	i dyed a stack of 2 rose gold collars platinum and then it showed i had 2 platinum collars but i had only used 1 dye brush then when i dyed another item it updated to 1 platinum collar and one rose gold collar
	Finally when i dyed the second rose gold collar platinum it did not stack with the other one immediatly
	Actually its just not letting me select it period
	Ok if i mess with the stacks a bunch it fixes it but that code definitely needs sanity checks
	Yeah so if you dye an item that is stackable to the same colour as another in your inventory it breaks one of them preventing you from interacting with it directly
	
	the "Report back" option doesn't disappear after reporting back once, although it doesn't do anything
	
	Is how good you are at a blowjob supposed to increase? Because mine doesn't. Ever. Maybe my guy is just that bad lol.
	
	Unsure if intended behavior or not, but typing in the name of a save, then hitting the enter key instead of pushing the save button will cause the main UI window to blank and the program to do nothing.
	  Expected behavior would assume that hitting enter would be the same as pushing the save button, but that may be hard to code in.
	
	: I think wearing a chastity belt and then getting fucked by brax while wearing pants has him perpetually masturbate instead of fuck you
	"I'm going to fuck you senseless" -> masturbates
	and he wont pull down pants, so the moment you do it, he actually fucks you
	
	brax loop for letting him impregnate you and then feminize him (gets looped in delivering scene)

	With the preview release, in the clothing section of the encyclopedia, the colour list wraps, but the fields do not extend to accomodate it, so it clips into the next entry's list.
	
	Lilaya's LAB_EXIT is unsuitable for pregnancy text
	
	Pure Virgin NPCs should probably not beg you to fuck them in the puss if you're teasing it with your cock.
	
	 Impregnated Bree, then bimbo'd her and pregged her again
		Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but either way this happened:
			[two ongoing pregnancies for Brax, pregnancy stage: pregnant]
	
	How about a derived fetish from exhibition and masochism?
		Humiliation Fetish?
	
	Partner not making a move when sub and getting dom-oral
	
	encountered a problem with text saying I had a Knot even though I have a human penis. Didn't happen often, only saw it once or twice, think it only happened when I was with Dog-girls too
	
	Similar buffs could extend to things like anal creampie for anal fetishists, pregnancy for pregnancy fetishists.  Some fetish buffs would have to be applied after certain acts are done, such as causing a pregnancy chance for seeders.
		Would probably make sense to have that replace the exp boost from taking virginities.
		(Taking virgiinities would give a bigger/different buff than seeding would.)
	
	add an action to ask for them to keep going in sex
	
	Tantric Fetish
		It would encourage a partner to keep on going for more orgasns/ it could give you an extra arcane esscence for each orgasm you and your partner have.
		 get rested bonuses from having sex for a long time from the meditative/spiritual aspect of tantra

	Lactation fetish, actions
	
	Vaginal wetness to determine squirting
	
	That's a good point about your phone... Once I expand the character creation screen, I'm going to let you choose your starting clothes, so I'll rework that part of the intro then (so that you keep your clothes). ^^
	I'm going to be adding conversation actions with Lilaya soon, and I'll add one for talking about your phone, good idea!
	Oh, and I'll probably expand the generic NPC encounters so that they try to run away if they've lost to you several times.
	
	
	UPDATE Lilaya & Kate SCENES:
		Getting a lot of game-halting bugs when trying to use the finger yourself command when doin the do with Lilaya
		Some embedded buttons are completely missing
	
	some descriptions could maybe change according to your characters orientation because it seems strange that an androphilic character stares and gulps at for example the stylist or other female assets
	
	if you have a tail and either suck it or self-tail peg, in the selfie tab the first time is given to your partner.
	
	If I select "Orgasm" instead of "Stay in position", I won't get a chance of pregnancy, I won't get pregnant, and I won't even get a creampie status, even though the flavor text says I got hella cum in my 100% fertility vagina.
	
	Please deal with the terrible finger sucking once and for all
	
	succubus is still not using her cock; add a preference for cock actions to her
	
	When you have the observant perk and examine someone, it shows what they are, but it also shows what they look like. The two statements are useful, but how they're blended (or, rather, not) can be rather jarring.
	
	Might be useful to be able to hide one or more sections in the pregnancy stats (ongoing pregs / completed pregs / offsprings list), because after having too many pregs with the seeder fetish, that page became quite long
	
	 i just got into a bug where the wolf futa i was having sex with pulled out just as her arousal reached 100 and its staying in an infinite loop where she is doing nothing

	One of the NPC's quotes for a top-heavy PC is something like "How much Bubble Milk have you been drinking?!" Since bubble milk is no longer an item in the game, I feel that this quote has been overlooked.
	
	The gender detection is terrible ^^
	
	slightly change the flavour text for the Lusty Maiden stuff (to say they use pussy, but no penetration)
	
	The ability to have NPCs suck on your tail
	(furry tail option)
	
	I've always wished more games with combat would implement more sadomasochism stuff. I'm thinking something like, the less health you have, the harder you hit.
	 Maybe a perk of some kind. Could be health based or seduction based. Maybe a fetish like the more aroused you are, the more you arouse others.
	Also, attacks and teases that deal recoil damage of some kind. Like a really powerful tease that arouses the user or an attack that's self-inflicted but deals a lot of damage or arousal to the opponent. Something like that.
	Generally combat stuff that says "I will kill you by beating myself up!"
	I'm thinking something like Double Edge, where you take recoil damage, or Counter, where you deal twice the amount of damage you took, except with the emphasis being not on
	 "I was reckless and hurt myself but at least I beat you up" and more of "Getting hurt IS my attack!"
	 I don't want getting hurt to be a side effect of why I win, I want getting hurt to BE why I win
	
	
	 I'm still of the opinion that for whatever the next iteration of the character development system is, a system similar to D&D should be investigated.
	  One where your "Core" attributes are actuall core, and extremely difficult to alter(and probably tied to the TF's),
	   while the incremental changes that happen upon leveling up apply only to things that are safe to have increase infinitely(like the ability to overcome/resist specific interactions)

	When you're having a scene with Lilaya, sometimes a button will not respond, and if you switch button pages and return, the button is missing
		For me, it was during the first scene with Lilaya. I tried to finger self, and it did not appear to respond, so I switched pages, came back and the button was gone.
		 I tried some other things to get the scene to progress, then other buttons stopped responding, like feel breasts, etc, during the scene.
		Once the scene progressed, things would return to normal for a while. I have not noticed the issue with Kate or random NPCs though.
		: I tried other actions later in the scene, and some buttons would just not respond, and flipping through the pages would make those unresponsive buttons vanish until the scene progressed.
	
	When I exported my character it was a pregnant herm, and import screen and selfie after importing show the same as well as I have the pregnant status effect.
	 However when I drank a "mother's milk" to speed it along so I could get preggers again, the potion dialog said nothing happened since I wasn't pregnant and the status timer didn't budge from the time left in that stage. 
	 That's as far as I got last night before passing out tho; Haven't tried receiving vaginal sex yet to see what happens.
	
	
	I've been using the masturbation fetish for those sort of options, but that doesn't really make much sense. I'll add a fetish for 'manual stimulation' (both for giving and receiving)
	
	While the shop is renamed 'Pix's Playground', the fast-travel button at the mall entrance is still 'City Gym'.
	
	Since v0.1.81 at least, there's a bug involving the standing/sitting NPC sex scenes (Lilaya, Kate), where trying to do self-penetration (pink-text) actions will lock up the dialogue.
	 Specifically, the scene won't progress and the only working button is 'Use item'; clicking on it will advance arousal but returning to the main screen doesn't advance the scene, and some of the options disappear.
	  It seems to happen when the partner is also self-penetrating, although from what I've been able to test, the logic isn't consistent (Lilaya doing all three - mouth, nipples, tail - doesn't cause the lock-up, but any one on its own does).
	   So far as I've tested, this does NOT happen with street NPCs, and normal intercourse is unaffected. I'm not familiar with Java so I haven't looked at the source code, but it seems to be unique to these characters' arrangement.
	
	
	Multi-breast option for unique NPCs
	
	Add unique scene for succubus taking virginity with tail.
	
	Combine potion effects!
	
	Add better reaction dialogue for:
		Starting sex with areas exposed
		Revealing areas while resisting
	
	Special daughter code :3
	
	veils
	
	If the system generates an NPC with a derived fetish (which is actually good) it should make sure they have the prerequisite fetishes too
		So basically grab from hat; if selections have prereqs, add those too
	
	I took the virgin trait, then I took my own virginity with my tail.  The game was not prepared.  It said the succubus I was having sex with did it.
	
	save game in sex/combat
	
	
	An easier fix for the moment might be to make it harder to level up.  You do seem to climb way faster than you should.  Especially since the game basically starts you off at level 2 if you just go to the lab.
	
	Clothing enchanting
		Maybe locks a character to a certain TF
		Or makes them always use a certain pace
	
	Used condom mechanics (enchant + impregnate)
	
	+ tit fucking
	+ hotdogging
	+ thigh sex
	
	voyeur fetish as a partner to exhibitionist
	
	character rework, ask the player if non-con is to be on or off. Same with TF
	
	When you explore the harpy nests after you finish the quest you wont find anything instead the look for trouble command is what you use so having the explore command there is redundant and possibly confusing
	
	It'd be even better if their scaling could be made dynamic based on time, and for the player's children the level of both parents at conception.
	
	Ralph's scenes
		The turn after I pushed us onto the brink of a mutual orgasm, a customer arrived. After clicking "Mutual Orgasm", I got the text for my climax, followed by the "part of your discount was offered to the customer" text,
		 followed by "you stayed quiet, they didn't find out you were there!" Then after the customer leaves Ralph's climax text hits. Then he offers me the full 25% discount. When I get back to the shop menu, however, it's listed as 20%.
	
	
	5) Also on the Non-Con Train, the description of your partner in the "Step Back" screen after the dirty deed has been done is also positive.
	 After 12 orgasms, the formerly Pure Virgin Non-Con partner shouldn't be "thoroughly satisfied because you gave them what they wanted."
	  Without getting too brutal you could say something along the lines of "Your reluctant partner lay panting in your combined fluids, their trembles a mark of their attempted resistance and ultimate failure to do so" or something. 
	
	It seems that hitting enter after typing in a name on the save game screen glitches it out.  You need to click off of the text box.
	
	Pix multi-breast
	
	You cant get rid of harpies although i have not tested after the harpy quest is finished

	Tooltip persisting on window switch
	
	Regarding my suggestion of changing stats to different names (so you don't have strength or fitness, which don't have any bearing on the player's appearance), coming up with names for new stats that make sense was fairly easy.
	  They can be things like 'force of personality' or 'self-control', things which make a lot of sense to influence how good you are with magic and how strong your aura is.
	    That gives you a set of combat stats that then don't have any bearing on your appearance.
	The snag I actually ran into is actually the special attacks that various body types and transformations give you, abilities that are obviously not derived from magic at all.
	  It wouldn't be too hard to change enemies up so that they don't attack you directly, instead using magic to hit your aura, but those special attacks would have to be completely
	   redone since it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for claws to give you a new spell that you can't get otherwise.
	
	
	In the same way dicks will be getting flags it would be nice if pussies could also get a couple more variables for stuff like labia size/shape. It would also be nice if their pubic hair and it's potential styling were a flag rather than a matter of race. 
	Similarly it would be nice if nipples could get a bit more details like size, shape, state of inversion. Areola size/shape. 
	( For example it would be hot if some nipples started inverted but then 'pop' out once they get stiff from arousal.
	 While some, especially fuckable nipples should probably stay inverted regardless of arousal. As for Areola being to make them puffy separately from the nipples base size would be neat.)
	
	Brax dom not using proper actions?
	
	
	implement a sort of fetish-inheritance system
	
	-Child race is determined as one of the parent's dominant race (50/50 of player or partner's race, perks determine if player is more or less likely)
	-Child's furriness rating is determined to be something between the parent's furriness (random, average, or based on player choice of which)
	-Furriness is same as furry preference settings.
	-Humans are essentially all races with no furriness, so their race is ignored when determining what race the child will have (only if the child's furriness is 0 are they human)
	-The gender of the child is determined based on a mix of the natural birth rates for their race and the player's gender preferences, based on a setting chosen in the gender preference menu.  The options are:
	--All natural births (children are always the natural genders, ex: humans are 50% male and 50% female, harpies are 50% traps and 50% female)
	--Some preferred births (children are mostly natural genders, with a 10-33% chance to instead follow the player's gender preferences)
	--Natural preferred births (children are always natural genders, but will follow the player's gender preferences when possible, ex: if either male or female are enabled, the split will be based on the players gender preferences, otherwise it's the default)
	--All preferred births (children's genders are always based on the player's gender preferences)
	
	{
	Gender prefs aren't being applied to offspring.
	-Natural birth only (all children are born based on their race's natural birth rates only, human 50% male/50% female, harpy 50% trap / 50% female)
	-Rare unusual births (most children are born with natural genders, but unusual ones have a small chance to trigger)
	-Natural preferred births (all children are born with natural birth genders, but will respect the player's gender preferences when possible)
	-All births preferred (children will use the player's gender preference sheet)

		Vicky's for example is getting kinda cramped with the new additions, and will get even more so if things keep going at this rate.
	
	AI are trying to remove all pen before orgasming? :s
		": Diana basically removed my finger from her ass, pulled off my dick from her throat, stopped fingering my pussy and then came"
	
	
	a decently game-breaking bug: Diana has an infinity loop where she stops the kissing action the PC initiated as the dom. When selected again she does it again to no end. So kissing is bugged for her atm.
	It seems Lexi has the same problem as Diana, and the issue is not an infinite loop but they just constantly stop kissing
Also noticed the Stop partner self action option disappears.
	
	Also, Face/Back to wall options do not become available until the selection of another position. I checked with doggy style.
	
	equipping items with global resist doesn't actually buff any of your resistances
	
	 Succubus attacker scene, submissive (no fight), with a new character (level 3): in 69, she struggles to blow my character (stretching her mouth for like 5+ turns); she then forces me to blow her,
	  and despite i have a standard mouth, there is no streching at all (for a 19 inch demonic cock...); am I naturally talented ? :LTmouth:
 Oh and despite being horny as fuck, and stating clearly she's going to fuck me, even if I request anal and she puts me in an anal-enabling position, she never goes for it, too busy stimulating herself with her various... tools
	
	Regarding Ralph's scene: i tried twice to ask for a big discount asap; it stops the sucking scene, Ralph says or does nothing (except stopping getting sucked), and... that's all. From there, the only available options are Wait
	 (Ralph does nothing either) / Calm down / Starting sucking (again; seems to work, except the big discount option isn't there anymore). More or less default male human character.
	( I think you need to get him suitably aroused first, 60 arousal or so?)
	Okay, this is only a matter of arousal; I tested with 40+ arousal on Ralph but with clothes on, and it works (he pulls everything himself when i select the option)
	
	
	the assaulting succubus doesn't have her racial trait, despite being Greater (and fully Demonic)
	
	Change sex actions into categories:
		[pen actions]
		[orifice actions]
	
	Saving in combat is causing a bug where if you reload, the enemy retains their lost health from before the load
	
	So apparently if you start as Androgynous Woman on the body, then chose your pronoun prefernce to be male, it ends up in that scenario:
		"You are a female man."
	
	
	Quests really need sorting out
	
	Fix Brax|bree options
	
	
	
	Mother's milk text, when using on an NPC, says "You eagerly gulp down the rich, creamy..."
	
	Stats panel is still creeping down and pushing your partners stats into unreadability during sex.
	Additional the masochism fetish doesn't seem to be working properly. was fighting an NPC and seduced them down to 8 points of willpower and punched them for 20 points of health damage and she took no willpower damage
	
	
	 think I found a bug, in the alley I have a wolf-girl like mark or stay in the place, then press the explore button several times so can she show up, but instead of the wolf-girl it was dog-girl
	 
	
	Far too many oral virgins
	
	To enable things like slime cat-girls:
	: Body part "materials"
		EG: "Flesh" is the default part "material"
		But later you could add "Slime"
		"Rock" for like golem arms
		"Phantom" for telekenetic parts
		"Energy" for elemental parts like a Fire elemental
		"ghostly" for ghost parts
	
	Sex UI to show pen types
		Also just have one 'fetishes' icon
	
	Missionary (mating press if have impregnation fetish)
	
	 the game still says for npcs that wear fishnet top + cupless bra that I don't know their nipples (No exposed status effect)
	  It says her large boobs are now exposed
	You've never seen her naked chest, so you don't know what her nipples look like
	
	AI in sex:
		Horse boy pulled out at 98 arousal in doggy-style
	
	
	I guess if it's in the player's hands (Like an option saying 'BAD END: Submit totally to Brax.'), then bad ends could be ok.
	
	furry tail option
		Well, I don't think it will be included by default, due to my concerns with how it would feel, but I could add a toggle in the options menu to enable it. It wouldn't really be any extra work to do that, and I guess everyone is happy then.
	
	Yeah, I'll add some more variation so that more NPCs resist if you have non-con turned on. At the moment, it's just virgins or NPCs that aren't attracted to you who will resist. ^^
	
	Add some more speech during sex, like little unique lines to say based on what fetishes they have.
	
	add a cryptic "on loan from Merle" note to Vicky
	
	make 'litter size increase' a stat to be manipulated like all the others
	
	Speaking of finger sucking, is it possible to make other people suck your fingers? I know you can stick your fingers everywhere else.
	
	Fetishes besides exhibitionist (and crossdresser) should be taken into account for clothing choices, too. Like a buttslut should be more likely to wear backless panties. And a pure virgin should probably never wear anything crotchless
	
	Add some variation to clothing removal priorities
		I might make some NPCs only interested in starting penetration as soon as possible
		Anal fetishists should only care about revealing ass (split receiving and giving fetishes)
	
	I should add 'storm' status effect to the sex screen, so it's clear that the storm is having an influence on them.
		Pure virgin 'Tease her pussy' -> her response is begging to be fucked x_x (Due to storm though???)
	
	Orgasm actions are sometimes defaulting to the special ones, sometimes the default ones :s
		MUTUAL ORGASMS!!!
		deepthroat during her orgasm, "you feel her insider slighlty twitching as her body shakes from her orgasm"
	
	harpy begs for sex after fight
	Than it proceeds like its rape
	Issue linked with Pure Virgin fetish/effect?
	
	The dog-girl grins at you as your no breasts are revealed, "Aww, are you trying to become a girl?"
	
	I sometimes couldent deepthroat cum intop a harpy (no mutual orgasm is the cause)
	
	 put some rudimentary java install instructions on the blog, followed by instructions on how to launch jar files via the command line.
	
	Harpy fingering :s
	
	You're right, it does remove the possibility of female NPCs using oral/masturbation actions in those positions. I didn't quite think that one through, and will most likely revert it in the next update. ^^

	I'm also planning on completely revamping the character creation screen soon (as well as adding 'penis virginity'), and once I do that there will be a lot more starting traits to choose from! ^^
	
	Seems cock size and cum production can be boostet infinitely while descriptions seem to cap out at stallion-sized/extreme, not sure if intentional or not.
	 Cum production also doesn't seem to have any effect when you're on the receiving end of the cock, in neither dominant nor submissive scenes that I've tested, not sure if a bug or just incomplete.
	  Deepthroating also doesn't seem to stretch your throat at all. As an aside on blowjobs there should probably also be an option to cum in someone's mouth,
	   or have them cum in yours and then spit/swallow/play around with it, etc as desired, possibly with a rough action to force swallow.
	 20% human encounters also seems to be broken, didn't get one human on that setting, but it might just have been RNG fucking with me.
	
	Also, possible bug but may also be intended: With the Exhibition Fetish enabled, wearing a pair of backless panties adds the +12 Willpower damage status, but does not remove the +4 variant as is expected.
	 Shifting them aside and removing them properly removes the +4 status, leaving the +12 variant in play, but replacing or re-equipping them produces the previous results of both statuses being applied.
	  Checked with my stats page to confirm that it is in fact affecting my character in this manner and the math checks out and is consistent with the statuses being simultaneously applied.
	   Key note is that the same results do NOT occur when using other types of clothing that blocks view of the genitals.
	 This was tested and remains consistent with both male and female characters. Saves used were created with current build, 0.1.81.
	 + assless chaps
	
	
	fondling balls is associated to oral fetish
	
	Pix scene behind non-con
	
	: I could add a 1-turn check so that if you've displaced that clothing, they prefer to displace on that same turn
	: I should also add a 'forbid self-clothing interaction' action
	
	exhibitionists wearing overbust corsets
	
	Could be fun to play around with that number. Like fetish affecting the outcome or how you do the combat maybe?
		"weakness exploited + 2 essance"
	
	wouldent it be better to change the "your naturel dog-morph's ears colour is black"
		To "your naturel dog-morph's fur colour is black"
	change the descriptions to say "You now have a dog-like tail, covered in black fur."
	
	are the foodstuffs supposed to have a transformation effect before they're made into potions or what because Rose warns you to be careful of everything you do unless you want to turn into a catgirl.
		hint at encahnting system
	
	: I should add 'forbid partner' to consensual scenes, to give you more control
	
	the game considers me penetrating Lilaya as me getting fucked by her in the dirty talk: "Don't stop! Fuck me!"
	
	use the matriarch items on NPCs
	
	1) Any harpy you encountered before making it safe will be impossible to meet their saved icon will remain on the area but they can't be encountered.
	2) After making the nest safe it is impossible to encounter the same harpy twice. Her icon remains but when you click look for trouble a completely different harpy shows ups.
	
	
	Brax sex ended with pregnancy warning. Last action was orgasm while getting licked.
	
	Dual strike text doesn't take into account misses
	
	Enemies seem to add more acceseries every time i encounter them
		they just keep putting on more clothes

	Could there be a fun stat for how many undies or jewelry stolen?
	
	also a rape fetish for NPCs that makes them always resist
	
	Pix has multiple rows of breats despite the fact that I've turned off the multi-breast setting. Is this because she's a pregenerated character?
	
	It'd be interesting if perks like cum addict and nympho had a bonus if they were satisfied recently, and a penalty if you've gone a while without cum/sex
	
	After giving a random npc mother's milk, the dialogue description's 3rd paragraph is addressing the PC instead of the npc: "You eagerly... overwhelms your senses... Before you know...." Etc.
	
	Mother's milk for kate
	
	
	Importer is deleting core stats
	
	
	AI:
		1. An enemy with the Dominant personality just shouted Dirty Talk at me. Not even finger sucking or anything else, just that.
	
		Even after giving permission, the NPC doesn’t help with stripping of clothing. They don’t even take their own clothes off. Related to this, NPCs are still not taking off their bottoms generally speaking, not related to the permission.
	
	
	
	Cum fetish needs variation for nympho.
		Timings for punishments.
			
			
	Add player sexuality as part of the gender preferences option menu
	
	font size: large is causing the boxes in furry preferences to not fit the text.
	
	Not sure if this is a bug, but since Brax became repeatable he now prefers anal without the Anal fetish.  In 10+ attempts I have never had him take my character vaginally regardless of whether I was a futa or pure female.
	
	
	Need to change onVirginity loss to take into account NPC and their penetration type.
	
	by the way Innoxia, were you aware that for some reason every time I take an enemy, they now lean against my tiny/large breasts?! I'm playing male this play through, no breasteses in selfie, yet lol
		as in sexebrating my victory over an opponent
	
	Random potion/elixirs as drops
	
	futa harpies a possibility.
	
	Oh and another bug, the "allow clothes" and "forbid self actions" buttons don't appear at the very start of sex with the matriarchs, you have to do certain actions first.
	
	During sex, If an NPC (Any race) removes their top I don't know what their breasts look like, but if I remove their top I do know what their breasts look like.
	

	
	Also, "stroke cock" only works during sex with Brax now, and not in any other sexual encounter.
	Btw, Innoxia, stroke cock is still not working.
	Also, "stroke your cock" during sex doesn't work.
	
	Skin/eye/hair/fur colour groups
	
	Pregnant demons to grow penis? Doesn't this break pregnancy? :o
	 
	 Nah, sex again afterwards with a normal creampie caused the 'there's a chance she'll get pregnant' message.
	  If there was a prior valid creampie, it would have given the 'if she wasn't already pregnant, there's a chance she is now' message. And I just discovered that Pussy2Mouth does not take your partner's oral virginity.
	
	Just restarted and tried the Brax encounter.  Attempted a Cowgirl but for some reason, I can't ride Brax's cock.
	
		
	Bree/Brandi pregnant talk
	
	
	If Brax beats you, when he takes off your clothes it replaces his name with yours
	
	I'm not sure if this was a bug or not but when testing the above bug, Brax as the dom wouldn't seem to start vagina sex until the exact moment you orgasm,
	 which is what made me notice the above bug in the first place. So I tried testing as many times as I could but Brax for some reason just wouldn't cooperate,
	  he'd do start anal sex before I'd orgasm but not vaginal, I just thought it was weird, might be a bug, might not, I dunno.
	
	Transformation fetish NPCs to be hybrids

	I tried recoloring bree's panties in black but just spent one brush. Can you either avoid dyeing on these kind of NPC's or make it persistent,
	
	
	Taking own (anal) virginity using tail gives Brax taking virginity scene
	
	
	after I move to the left and then return to Candi's desk I can't actually do anything to Brandi, and when I moved away from the desk, the game acted like I was still interacting with Candi, with Brandi's inventory screen instead of the map

	No option to be bottom if you win as a male.
	 Also, I've seen a rather odd bug: at random I'll get a notice when an NPC has breasts or genitals exposed that I've never seen what that body part looks like, even though I'm now staring right at them.
	 So far the Succubus and a couple other general NPCs have had that at least once when they or I uncover their chest or any goodies downstairs.
	  I'll try a fresh new game later on as I realize I keep using my old saves and forget that that might cause issues as well.
	 One more thing, not really an issue but some might find it annoying: there doesn't seem to be a way to skip the intro anymore.
	
	
	I'm glad that the new enchanting system has addressed that other issue, but I might still add a 'Drink all' option for non-crafted potions/consumables. ^^
	
	
	I didn't see this in the notes but I noticed that the prices for Ralph's goods have gone up a bit, not a huge amount but things do cost a bit more.
	
	I know harpies are getting worked on, but just adding that I have encountered female harpies with the the deflowering fetish.
	 Also, harpies with a pregnancy fetish that ask me to breed them are still mad when I encounter them again and they are pregnant.
	
	
	I'll change those kissing descriptions soon (they don't really fit very well at the moment, you're right).
	
	Oh, also, Anonymous, I'll get that issue fixed as well. I'll make it so new vaginas have some starting wetness and elasticity, thanks for the feedback! ^^
	
	
	I'm not exactly sure what caused it, but after crafting potions I'm unable to exit the inventory screen
		The last thing I crafted was a human potion of larger testicles
		Also, the selfie screen seems to always say you have a genderless mound along with any genitals you have
		Can't seem to remove jynxed clothing, clicking the clothing in the dejynx menu doesn't do anything
	
	
	crotchless briefs
	
	 I equipped a pair of shoes that spawned cursed and I didn't get the quest to ask lilaya how to remove them
	
	Getting mound description in selfie even when ahving penis + vagina
	
	Harpy nests
		Harpy attack
		Three matriarchs
	
	Consider uncommon (green) items
	
	Fetish dreams
	
	
	Enchantments upgrade
		Allow multiple effects
			Combine same effects
			
	Add text feedback for when potion is crafted
	
	virgin killer (+groin cover)
	fishnet skirt
	
	
	Add more demon types
	
	
	Writing improvements needed:
		Virginity loss (nipple, throat)
		All sex actions.
		Check deflowering for other orifices
		Rewrite and improve a lot of those 'ongoing' descriptions during sex. (NPC's generateGenericPenetrationDescription method)
		
	
	Orgasms
	
	
	Tattoos
		
	Fix lag in clicking items in inventory
		
	I especially like the stripping reactions from PC/NPC as breasts and genitals are revealed, adds fun immersion. But I find that extra scene is missing if already naked or wearing crotchless panties.
	 Any chance of a reaction to those at start of battle/sex encounters? I'm sure some would give catcalls ;D Bonus for naughty exposed virgins.
	
	Add flavour text to explore action
	
	In Lilaya’s climax scene: that scene states that she pulls herself off the PC’s cock, but the game doesn’t reflect.

	This includes, but is not limited to, character concepts and designs, written art, programming code and/or logic, accompanying art, sound effects, voice acting, or music.
	
	
	
	
	The ability to give Mother's Milk to pregnant characters, for sudden growth, or to hurry up and get them un-pregnant as quickly as possible.
	
	Increase cum/milk amount from potions.
	
	Add a way to jinx clothing
	
	Ralph scene, he uses tests until he knocks you up
	
	Go through all unique scenes and fix (don't expand yet, not enough time)
	
	Add rough/gentle/normal start for victory
	Add resist/eager start options to harpies
	
	Make it so you can switch positions even if penetrating (remove all penetration)
	
	AI in sex
		Make them get on with penetration a lot quicker than they currently do
			Make them prefer penis penetration
			
		Far too keen on self-actions
	  		
	  	Only the male human I fought and lost to had me doggy and just quite literally sat there and did nothing (his turns actually boiled down to him taking no action at all) until just before he came. 
			So far the option to be bottom for either male or female PC's is no where to be seen and even NPC's seem content to sticking to foreplay only.
	
	Go through and make sure resist is before normal->eager
	
	Maybe change it so that NPCs (while being the sub) will be allowed to penetrate you if your pace is gentle.
	
	add "feathered wings" to the [npc.arm+] command for harpy arms
		Rewrite harpy hands
		Leaving it as the arm ending in a hand covered in plumage and with feather-like fingers coming out if should work just fine.
		Parser "hand" and "finger"/"fingers" commands for harpy
	
	Allow unique NPCs to wear condoms, drink MM, take pills, etc.
	
	"Buy all I can afford" option instead of buy all when you can't afford all items in a stack
	
	Insemination orgasm (requires free cock, free pussy)

	**Tail vagina**
	**Tail anus**
	**Tongue nipple**
	**Tongue anus**
	
	Bimbo lover/Bimbo
		-> braindead bimbo (all you can think about is bimbos)
	
	
	Add partner reactions during sex. (I'd be great if that remark from Lilaya was made as a response to that comment from the PC on the same 'turn')
	
	Add corruption requirements for rape/resist for NPCs
	
	
	
	Extra action descriptions for future:
		Face-to-wall:
			Reach around to breasts.
			Reach around to stroke cock.
			Descriptions of pushing into wall while fucking. (Reaching down to hold hips etc.)
		Pretty much every action x_x
			(They are all very generic and boring.)
		Orgasms in kneeling don't take pace into account properly.
		Orgasms in kneeling need a mutual variant.
		Expand/incorporate pace for all orgasms
		Herm fun in sixty-nine.
		Doggy actions:
			Grope breasts (reach around description).
			Add 'tail pull' as a rough action (grabbing base of tail and pulling back onto cock as fuck them). Remove this description from the generic 'Rough'.
			Add gentle fucking.
	
	
	Pregnant:
		belly rubbing action during gentle pace
		belly rubbing, belly wobbling during rough

		Are they working correctly?!?!
	
	Allow position changes while penetrating
		Remove all penetration on position/manager change.
		
	
	
	Fisting
	Head pats
	Ear scratching
	Specifically targetting cat-morphs, scraches just above the tail
	
	Add way to change sexual preferences and fetishes (at orgasm). [Requires mind-break fetish]
	
	retcon lore (not everyone is willing)
	
	Handle partner orgasm when you're not ready (still give player option of how to react)
	
	Add UI display for arousal gained. (arousal/turn)
	
	Improve "Recovering orifice" status effects (show timer and icon for orifice)
	
	
	Support partner-less sex.
	
	Lilaya's room
		Laundry basket
			steal dirty panties
			cumming in Lilaya's dirty panties
		Drawers
			steal panties
			cumming in Lilaya's clean panties
		
	Smell front/back
	Lick front/back
	Fantasise
	Penis:
		Wrap around jerk-off
		Stroke over head
		Rub over balls
	Vagina:
		Push inside
		Rub over clit
	Mound:
		Rub over mound
	Orgasm:
		Muffle mouth
		Cum in panties
		Stuff inside
		
		
	Rose romance (fem-dom, requires feminine player):
		(Rose has sub and dom fetishes.)
		Ask to help out.
		She gives you a maid uniform.
		She becomes really dom.
		Have to go around helping her clean the house.
		She forces you to eat her out.
		When romance level is high, she shows you 'extra' duties (teaches you how to get fucked by Lilaya in a threesome).
	
	
	
	Direct cum in orgasm
	
	I'll add a 'drink all' option to stacks of potions
	
	egg laying content. When Lilaya is the father, don't get aggressive towards her, and instead force her to help you protect your eggs.
	
	Colour for hotkey on button
	
	blend together potions for the same affects in a single potion
	
	I'll probably do as you suggest, and add in a 1 or 2 day timer before NPCs get new clothes.
	
	Would be nice to have a bit better highlighting on perks you've already taken.
	
	It should probably be possible to call for Rose from your room
	
	Hair styles
	
	add lactation increases during pregnancy.
	
	Braindead bimbo fetish
	
	Body toning
	
	add life-spans to the encyclopdia entries
	
	the auto fit of the text on buttons looks odd. better return it to the way it was before. The text shrinks, making it contrast and out of place compared to the text on other buttons.
	
	go through documents. (The ones that person sent you ^^)
	
	If the player has a the "pure virgin" and "love" fetish, they'll gain the "innocent virgin" derived fetish.
		This fetish makes it so the player doesn't gain "broken virgin" if they lose they virginity with a monogamous lover.
		But if for some reason they ever have sex with a non-lover npc, either by rape or cheating, they gain "broken virgin" too.
	
	Also, now that we can mass-produce potions, it might be useful to mass-feed people them
		(Add a 'use all' option or something)
	
	I have a suggestion, not sure where to put it in the suggestion doc, features? However, anyways not sure if this has been suggested or not.
	 Whenever you submit/ lose to an npc they only have one orgasm then leave, have not encountered one that has more than one yet.
	  Could it be possible to increase the number of times they can orgasm before they are satisfied? Maybe you could use their stamina to determine how many orgasms they can have, maybe 1 per 20 stamina points,
	   can change this to balance it out a bit? Whenever I fuck an npc I make sure to fill all of their holes, maybe there could be a few who try to do the same or an npc with an impregnate
	    fetish will make sure to empty themselves to make sure the chance of impregnation is high or something along the same line of thought.
	
	
	Make all penetrative actions ignore self-penetration. (You can fuck partner even if they're fingering themselves.)
	
	Fingerless elbow length (fishnet) gloves
	
	Need to display fetish requirements in tooltip
	
	Force fetishes on NPCs through spending arcane essences as they orgasm
	
	
	Sex:
		CHECK PHONE SEX DESCRIPTIONS
		
		TEST EVERY SEX SCENE
		Ralph: prioritise clothing removal before sex
		
		It seems that 69 sex is a position that can't be switched out of (and doggy?)
	
		because the option to request a pullout is X for me
	
		Better review the various buttons and the coloring post-refactoring.
	
	
	Content:
		After talking to Lilaya about any topic, one has to leave and re-enter the lab to talk to her again.
			Re-do all of Lilaya's scenes to allow continuation of talking.
	
		Harpy nests (Alexa and the three matriarchs)
		
		Harpy attacker
		Ok last bug report from me for tonight, I got a random harpy girl pregnant and it said this:
		"TODO: Harpy is pregnant encounter.
		You ended up getting Ralph pregnant, and now she wants revenge!"
	
		Scarlett quest progress
	
		----------
	
		
	Players with high enough strength/fitness and the dominant fetish should be able to flip the tables on Pix during her scene and dominate her
	
	Also, it'd be nice to be able to fuck Kate without her asking us to if we have high enough corruption
		Requirements: Cock, corruption>50
		Surprise penetration
	
	There's somewhat of an exploit with the bookcase in your bedroom. If you read the books you gain .5 intelligence from both books, but that's a one-time thing, I suppose.
		However if you save after getting the intelligence, close the game and reload your character you can read both again for a free 1 Intelligence each time you do this.
	
	perk descriptions (+25 or +60)
	
	Bimbo salon
	
	Fast travel to key places
		you could add a small quest item section to the inventory page, and have Lilaya give you some kind of magical teleportation item that you can "register" to certain frequently visited areas after you've been there once
	
	add Lilin corrupt into demon lore
	
	explore action in harpy nests
	
	Enchanting utility methods (recipe unlocks)

	Create TF fetish
		NPCs need TF preference, then TF the player post-defeat
			Race
			Gender
	
	Clothing in different slots
	
	Rewrite storm attack to make it clear that they're in heat/rut
	
	An auto strip button would be nice so you don't have to go through three menus each turn
	
	map view
	
	"punish" for sadist
	
	Make every Colour reference a BaseColor
	
	Incest encounter: Let PC define what son/daughter calls you
	
	Clothing durability:
		So the swimsuit (which I use for testing as it's the most awkward one), would have 'top half', 'bottom half', and 'midriff'.
		The top half being torn would reveal breasts, the bottom half would reveal groin, and the midriff would reveal stomach.
	
	--------------------------
	
	
		
	Make options:
		Breast count
		Furry
		Sexual preference
	
	Sex rework:
		Tail/hair pulling....
		Doggy style positioning changes...
		Add missionary at some point...
	
	
	
	Brax TF into wolf-girl or futa or shemale
		Let her dominate you afterwards
	
	
	3. Polish Brax's, Ralph's, and the Succubus's sex scenes.
	
	4. Options to interact with the succubus's nipples/tail will be included next version. (As well as demonic penis/vagina descriptions, and unique descriptions for the succubus.)
	
	6. Lilaya needs incest fetish
	
	
	Write variants for persistent NPCs encountering you after the first time.
	Polish all TF descriptions (especially the Harpy ones).
	Write in the next part of the story. (I may or may not have time to include a new sex scene, I think I may end up spending a lot of time polishing the ones that are already in the game.)
	
	Expand Lilaya & Kate pregnancy scenes
	
	I mean personally I take insane pride in teasing ralph by already being pregnant
	Ralph romance
	
	font style switcher
	
	And I'll be adding a way to upgrade potions into full-tf versions.
	
	Add something so that during the same scene they got genderbent in, NPCs acknowledge that their new genitals are new
	
	
	
	Affection:
		Random attackers (only in alleyway):
			Ask for name + Give your name
			->
			Ask why she/he attacked you (need money & then your aura turns them on)
			->
			Ask to be friends (they stop attacking you) OR if you have a slave collar, and the necessary documents, you can enslave them
			->
			Talk about life & have sex
			->
			Ask to move in (they move into Lilaya's home)
			->
			Scene with you introducing them to Lilaya
			->
			Can get sex in their room
	
	
	Change saving/loading files to use an InputStream

	Main goals:
		Lilaya romance quest (becoming a demon) Going along with the theme of incest, Lilaya's mother looks exactly like your mother.
			After sex, she mentions wanting to show you how she can TF herself
			Next sex scene, she offers transformations
			After sex, she says how it would be so much better if she were a full demon
			Agree to help
			Have to contact Lilaya's mother (she likes burning bridges...)
			Go find her at demon home
			Have to persuade her to come visit Lilaya (Lilaya really burnt some bridges here...)
				Let her fem-dom you
				Passionate appeal
			She takes up residency at Lilaya's home (for the rest of the game).
			Next time you visit, you find her just having arrived. (She is mercilessly teasing Rose, who is extremely uncomfortable.)
				Lilaya breaks it up
				Lyssieth decides to stay for a while (she has a couple of slaves with her)
			Meet Lilaya in lab again
				She is annoyed that you didn't ask Lyssieth to TF her. (As you didn't really get an opportunity)
		
		
	
	{
		
		[60] Improved parter positioning actions. If your partner is the sub, they will request positions, requiring you to either go along with it, or deny them (which will stop them from attempting to position themselves again).
		[120] Improve orgasms and sex action types (cum inflation)
		
		[120] Character creation expansion
		[45] Move race status effect icon up to be the level-up icon. (Then do the same with your partner in sex.)
		[180] Phone menus
	}
	
	
	time progression changes
		shops closing
		(UI changes...)
	
	[60]

		tongue names
	
		add preferred positions and random fetishes to attackers
		partners need to be limited by corruption/fetishes as well
	
	I'll add a way to get your fingers wet, so that you can transfer saliva to your partner's (or your own) orifices easily.
	
	finger insemination
	
	orgasm reactions (cumming on player parts needs more detail, as well as directing away)
		Partner fucking player example:
		You feel partner about to orgasm. (along with their chosen attempt, either cumming inside or pulling out)
		Reaction option for partner in vagina: Allow pull out | Force creampie
		
		Partner giving blowjob example:
		Choose: Deepthroat | Cum in mouth | Facial
		Partner: Resist/submit | spit/swallow | stay still/direct away
	
	
	deny for sub?
	
	Painful stretching description variants.
		Descriptions should be things like "You cry out in pain as the wolf-boy's massive knotted cock forces its way into your tight asshole."
		
		
	
	Improve horny demon's penetration & dirty talk text.
	
	nipple fucking in 69 & kneeling
	
	Is to have penetration (and various other things) sort of be a "passive" state where the scene just assumes there's thrusting going on even if you actively choose other actions
	So the actions related to penetration would be more about changing pace, withdrawing, or special actions like mutual orgasm or denial or whatever
	Make pink text more narrative.
	
	Add 'free' perks
		Sexual preference (fem++, fem, bi, mas, mas++)
		Furry preference (moved from options)
		Racial preference (can select multiple)
	
	Make attackers during storm in rut/heat
		Rough/ignore all requests.
		
	Brax secretary TF warning
	
	
	I'm also going to greatly expand the character creation options at the start of the game. There will be more options for hair/eye/skin colours, as well as options for starting piercings/tattoos/clothing.
	 I'll also add more detailed body options, so you'll be able to customise all your starting body sizes/capacities/elasticities etc.
	
	Mutual orgasms (cum inside and pull out)
	Better orgasms (import from old scenes)
	
	
	Make action types (so can highlight them as important):
		PLAYER_POSITION_SWITCH(isPlayerAction, isOrgasm)
		PLAYER_PENETRATION
		PARTNER_POSITION_SWITCH
		PARTNER_PENETRATION
		
	
	finish:
		Improved mutual orgasms so that you always have the choice of how you want to orgasm.
	
	
	[120] Add cowgirl (dom+sub) 60/60
	
	----- Rolling into pregnancy:
	Lilaya (doesn't want to get pregnant)
		She asks you to pull out
			If you don't, she starts having a rant at you. "Aren't I supposed to be your aunt?! You want to get your aunt pregnant?!"
			"Yes": She grows a demonic cock and tries to impregnate you as some sort of twisted punishment
			"No": Advances to next stage.
		If you aren't infertile, you get her pregnant, and she gets really pissed off at you (no more sex, as she's really quite furious).
		Trigger for Lilaya quest progress. (She says she'll kick you out if you don't do as she says)
		Have to apologise by going to tell her mother that you got her pregnant (she won't let anyone else help her give birth)
		Maid at mother's house says she'll inform her mistress.
		Lilaya forgives you (unlocks pregnant Lilaya sex)
		
		
	Kate (wants cum, doesn't care if she gets pregnant)
		Sex scene while she's pregnant (same, but with flavour text)
		She's lactating
		Can cum on her belly
	
	
	
	
	
	Make weapons equippable in both slots (ranged weapons do less damage, but have an in-built crit chance?)
	
	
	Change fetishes to highlight in the status bar if they're applying effects.
		(e.g. anal fetish will provide +20% arousal if any anal pen is going on)
	
	
	
	change minx and the other one to:
		sexual preferences (can switch between at any time) (I can't use homosexual or heterosexual, as the nature of the game switches the PC's gender often, which would get confusing):
		
		Gynephilic:
			+more likely to encounter females
			-take increased tease damage from females
			+take decreased tease damage from males
		Androphilic:
			opposite
		Bisexual:
			encounter females and males at the same rate
			standard tease damage from both
	
	Need to make corruption more punishing. (Now that all sex actions are unlocked)
	
	
	
	Make pregnancy fetish unable to use condoms
	
	Combat:
		Factor in enemy sexual preference for tease attacks (they take 25% damage if they're not attracted to your gender)
		Add 'free perks', which you can switch between.
			'Furry'
			'sexual preference'
			'multi-breast'
		
	Add slap and tickle (Should fit in with Pix's character)
	
	Enemy refinement:
		In storm, everyone's in a rut/heat, so they don't care what gender you are.
		Otherwise, males will rape and oral females, and only oral males.
		Females will rape and oral anything.
		Corrupted enemies will use a single transformation on you before sex (into their race or opposite gender).
			(Can smash first drink to get the other one if you prefer.)
			Females: "I can get rid of the competition!"
			Males: "This city needs more girls for me to fuck"
		
	
	Tooltip over perks bugs when near edge of screen. (cause of those three bug reports)
	
	When you choose to submit after winning a fight, the dialogue gets mixed up at the second line (the enemy speaks as if they're you, and you speak as if you're the enemy.) It's especially funny if you have the bimbo fetish. :P
	
	Brax orgasms need some polish
	Need more mutual orgasms
	
	Remove fetish turning you on text. Instead, list +20% arousal as a bonus for the fetish perk. (too much writing clutter)
	
	Add penetrating sex effects for penis
	
	balance attribute modifiers
	
	add "safe from storm" effect, to make it clear there is a storm going on outside
	
	-----------------
	
	update inventory UI when clothing gets dirty
	
	Make requirements obvious in tooltip for options
		This may be a part of the DialogueNode revamp
	
	
	Fix tooltip heights.
	
	
	change non-consensual stuff.
		sexual preferences (set on character creation and can edit in options)
		will be respected by non-corrupted NPC sex scenes
		(your character says you're not into that stuff, and they leave)
		If enemy is high corruption, they'll rape you anyway (keep Dominion attackers low corruption to avoid this)
		Weak-aura Demon and demon futa will be first high corruption enemies that don't give a shit
	
	
	Status effects post-sex:
		"afterglow" (dom non-con or con)
		"violated" (sub non-con)
		
	Add corruption gains for choosing to rape someone/do corrupt things.
	Make options that do this appear purple (like sex is pink and combat is red)
	
	
	Do all sex scenes' fetishes and re-writes
	Remember:
		pure=kissing, vanilla=all standard, horny=anal, dirty=getting crazy, lustful=feeding cum/depraved stuff, corrupt=forced incest impregnation stype stuff
	
	add variations in oral scene for if you're creampied
	
	Give characters a lung capacity, and a gag reflex stat for measuring their deepthroating skill.
	
	Use 'Used Condoms' as the test object for individual item types.
	These will be used in the pregnant random attacker's scene.
	alleyway encounter: see a girl getting fucked, they leave the used condom behind (so you know what cum is inside). gain corruption?
	
	level up screen: perks in tabs, so can make icons bigger/easier to see
	| Strength | Intelligence | Fitness | Fetishes |
	
	tooltip appearing on right for a split second sometimes	
	
	Make Brax's scene repeatable (maybe not though, as he will be making a re-appearance later on in the story...)
	
	Corrupted demons
	Force demon tf on you (they sense your aura)
	Lilith's pet (demon TF item)
	
	Throat stretched stuff.
	Stretching should be 1-time, and only do it at penetration or for special events (taking a knot)
	Add stretchOrifice(character, PenisSize) to sex, so there can be extra stretch evens other than initial penetration. can then use this method in applyEffects() in SexAction
	
	In selfie/body descriptions, highlight racial parts and colours.
	
	Pregnancies:
		(Them) Kate
		(Them) Randoms (with pregnant encounter)
		(You) Ralph reactions/sex
		(You) Brax reactions/sex
		(You) Lilaya reactions/no sex while pregnant
		
	

	"I also have some crash logs in my public Lilith Dropbox: https://db.tt/Xd1x14UWSG"
	
	Floor needs special type of inventory (I haven't even tested if it can overflow!)
	
	Make buttons for all attacks (for those that don't want to use keyboard)
	
	test piercing loss on body part loss
	
	Make sure all listeners are working/needed
	
	Make overview map
	
	Succubi's Secrets
		Tattoos
	
	save screen
	
	highlight text back (disable it in all non basic screens though)
	
	Change "Do nothing" to "In control" to "Full control" at higher corruptions
		
	[Multi-Breasts Off | Extra Breasts all flat | Multi-Breasts On].
	
	Melee spells: basic damage and basic protection/shields. Ranged spells: offensive and defensive utility, which can take many forms
	add steal spell (steals a random piece of clothing). If steal panties or bra, the opponent misses their next turn "W-What are your doing?! Y-You pervert!"
		Add display rack for stolen panties
	
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	simple and detailed version of icons (for performance and better artwork)
	
	Corruption:
	NPC condom use & pull out (low corruption, they will, middle they won't, high they say they will, then don't)
	"Guilty concience" status effect if vanilla and didn't do as NPC asked.
	
	Pregnancy lore. The children inherit characteristics of the father, even though they're of the race of the mother. E.g. a harpy giving birth to a horse-morph's children will produce stronger than average harpies
	
	Shower at gym have same effects as at home. Maybe make a "wash" method
	
	TF hair colour
	
	
	
   For that matter, you should probably make there be a "window" for fertilization (if you haven't already done this - I'm too tired to check the code right now) where if you "might" get pregnant,
    the father can be anyone who inseminates you within, say, the first hour (or more) of the "risk of pregnancy" status.
      but it's good if there's at least a mechanic in place which allows for uncertainty of paternity if the player is getting around a lot.
	
	 Content is really bare bones as most town locations aren't done yet, you can beat the weak ass enemies at level 1 no problem, and the main quest hasn't even completed the first act.
	  tf potions work, but suffers from major case of furry. Most clothing just adds 1 phys def with the exception of the jinxed circlets found via rng.
	
	Think about changing how TF items work.
		Something cool, but not too grindy.
		Like needing three components to unlock a tf.
		Then easier once you have that?
		
	Your aura collects essences from defeated enemies
	Used in crafting
	Lore:
		Go see Lilaya after the first time you collect an essence.
		She is really surprised that you can do that, as only Lilin have that power.
		It doesn't hurt the people you take essences from, it's more like a snapshot of their power.
		She has all the equipment to use essences to create powerful potions (she explains this is where TF items come from)
		
		
		
		
	Core component: dog/wolf/cat etc.
	3 slots for Modifiers (can use any of the following in each slot):
		TF
		Sexual TF
		Stats
		Boost
	
New content
    Add beauty salon to Shopping Promenade (change hair colours & get piercings/tattoos).
    Add more variation to random assailants (human/partial/lesser/greater tf status, varying breast/penis/vagina sizes, varying skin/fur colours).
    Add in more content for Lilaya's romance storyline.
    Add in a rare chance for a demon encounter during storms.
    Add Pix's shower scene.
    Work on finishing the next stage of the main quest. This will involve writing content for two of the currently disabled map locations. It will also add in a new race, basic slave management, and a unique NPC (of the new race). (This is a long-term goal for v0.1.7).

Gameplay
    Fix how storage works at Lilaya's home.
    Stop random encounters from occurring at several places on the map. (To fit in with some lore that's coming in the new content.)
    Polish and improve Brax's scene. This will involve removing the bad end and adding in three unique item drops.
    Add in an option to reduce the amount of furry content. This will greatly reduce the chances of random encounters being greater/lesser morphs, but will not alter the body types of any unique NPCs.
    Expand character creation options.

UI
    Finish the light theme (I know some of the text colours are unreadable at the moment).
    Finish font resizing feature.
    Buttons are sometimes off-screen when the game starts.
    The save game window is sometimes not opening. I'll investigate this.
    Fix hotkey names on response options. (At the moment, it says things like 'Close Bracket' instead of ']')
    Fix all text colours.
    Make it more obvious when you gain/lose a status effect.
    Make it more obvious that you can undress in sex.

Clothing
    Improve the enchantment/jinxed mechanics. possibly introducing a "sealed" mechanic to jinxed items.

Combat
    !!!Balance combat!!!
    Add some combat-related items, and implement item usage (healing & utility consumables).
    Improve shield spells.
    Improve weapons (both variety and spells gained).

Transformations
    Create some unique icons for the non-racial TF items.
    Add more TF items.
    Add more TF possibilities.

Sex
    Polish and fix bugs in all sex scenes.
    Properly apply new corruption mechanics to all sex scenes.
    General improvements to all sex scene descriptions.

1. There should be a "take all" and "drop all" button for items in inventory. "Sell all" and "use all" wouldn't hurt either, to avoid repetitive button pushing.

Another note: you've incorporated a very unusual fetish item into your game - that "finger insemination" thing you mentioned in the change log. I don't know how big the percentage is, but I've heard people griping about the lack of content like that - autoinsemination of various sorts, etc. In my usual tradition of spewing out ideas, here are some additional mentions in that vein in case you are interested:
-Insemination from ejaculating over a gaping pussy (only possible with low tightness; or immediately after intercourse, if you add a "pull out" option, assuming a large enough cock vs inelastic enough pussy (assuming you go with my elasticity modification above))
-If you ever add threeways, giving a BJ and not swallowing or spitting followed by oral on a female could be used to push semen inside a vagina
-If you ever add condoms, self insem. with used condoms (for EXTRA perversity, add used condom stealing from sex scenes the PC witnesses, for that purpose)
-If you ever add group/gang bangs, could have some kind of "sperm racing" event where PC takes a bunch of sperm from participants and inseminates herself (funnel? turkey baster?) to see which one gets to be a father

	-----------
	Lilaya romance:
		First time having sex, she forces you to pull out.
		After sex, she gets really awkward.
			Says she only had sex because of her demon instincts.
			She says she used every ounce of her willpower to resist you cumming inside of her, but it won't happen again, so DON'T CUM INSIDE OF ME!
			"This is why I avoid people! I-It's not like I want to go around fucking everyone I meet! A-Anyway, aren't I supposed to be your aunt?! W-What kind of pervert fucks their own aunt?!"
			"You started it!" "Sorry, I got carried away."
			From then on, she doesn't bother getting up when you find her fingering Rose.
		Have to apologise to her
			She tries to get away with a LOT. (Kiss her feet, massage feet, suck toes, full foot clean)
			You can say no at any time, so long as you said sorry she forgives you.
		Can 'trick' her into having sex again (this repeats until you get her pregnant).
		Cum inside her gets her pregnant (if corrupted enough, you can also use used condoms, as Lilaya can't resist being treated like a slut).
		She asks her mother to come help her give birth.
		Lyssieth enters, teases Rose, then asks you how you fucked her daughter.
			"So how did you impregnate my daughter hmm? Did you push her down on all fours, ripping her panties off, then fuck her like an animal? Filling her womb with your cum, growling down in her ear that she's going to carry your children?"
		Lilaya saves you and has an argument with her mother. (Lilaya is angry, Lyssieth apologising and treating Lilaya like a fragile child)
			"If you want to ask about how one of your daughters fucks, why don't you go ask one my countless sisters?!"
			"Please Lilaya, I have no interest in talking with those sluts. You know you're my only real daughter."
		Go see Lilaya after she gives birth (to imps), only to find that Lyssieth has locked her in chastity.
		Have to prove to Lyssieth that you can take good care of Lilaya (have to bring her to orgasm 5 times as she watches).
		Lyssieth concedes that Lilaya knows what she's doing, and tells her the Lilin's ultimate secret; how to turn people into demons.
		You can then get Lilaya to go full demon at any time.
		She can also turn you into a demon (non-reversible!!!)
	
	
	
	
	
	Add fucking stalls to slaver alley
		Make money by working there (get more for more holes: 25 base blowjob, +10 for vagina, +20 for anal, +10 for each fuckable nipple)
		Spend money to fuck a hole (costs 30 for blowjob, +15 for vagina, +25 for anal, +15 for each nipple)
			Charged after having sex, if you don't have enough, you're banned until you can pay off the debt
			
	Add pregnancy roulette to slaver alley
		Either pay to enter:
			You and 5 other guys cum in a slave (who's taken a Vixen's virility).
			Afterwards, you wait 30 mins for them to test who got her pregnant.
			If you got her pregnant, you have to pay the penalty of 800 flames.
			If you didn't, you win 100 flames.
		Or get paid to be the girl:
			6 guys fuck you after you've taken a Vixen's virility.
			You get tested to see who knocked you up.
			You get paid 200 flames.
	
	Felicity is a trap.
		she invites you in and tries to get you drunk
		flirts with you
		drunk sex (she gets really dominant when she's drunk. REALLY dominant...)
		
	Pix
		You enter the shower, no sign of Pix.
		As you're showing, you didn't hear her sneaking up behind you.
		She presses into your back and starts instructing you how to wash yourself.
		Reaches around and masturbates you (reward for having a proper clean), fingers ass (if penis, milks prostate), washes & feels breasts, kisses neck (tastes if all sweat washed off yet).
		Rubs soap over back and grinds her 6 breasts up and down your back.
		She doesn't let you turn around.
		Once you orgasm she calls you a good boy/girl and bounces away
		
	Scarlett (male lesser harpy)
		Harpy males have feminine names to seem even more submissive to females
		Ask for Arthur, he doesn't know his slave's names
		You say he's a human and Scarlett recognises him
		Tells you he'll tell you where Arthur is if you'll fill in on one of his fucking stalls. (he sold too many slaves, and now has a shortage of orifices for clients to fuck)
		Can repeat this for cash later on.
		He comes in and tells you to stop moaning so loud (he's trying to work).
		If you moan loudly again he comes in and puts a ring gag on you then fucks your face.
		Can SPH him.
		If refuse, you have to give him enough money to buy a new slave (800)
	-----------------
	
	Final boss for first act:
		Trap-loving high-class demon.

		Using Arthur (he's actually quite famous among arcane-users, Scarlett and Brax didn't realise quite who he was)
		She sent Brax after Arthur as she intended to buy him all along
		Arthur is being forced to create trap-creating arcane bracelets (he keeps telling her that won't work (only consumables can be manipulated into transforming people) but she won't listen)
		On defeat:
			She turns you into a trap (doesn't care about race).
			Have to watch as her house guests fuck other traps and cum in them.
			Gives you a choice:
				Have to lick out their cum.
				She lets you go if you beg her to allow the house guests to fuck your ass.
				This keeps going on until you ask to be fucked.
	
	
	UI criticism/commentary:
Buying and selling is painful; if you could add an intermediate "shop table" area where multiple items could be placed, that would alleviate a lot of the pain.
The minimap is a bit hard to use; from a glance, you cannot easily tell where you are; add an icon or something to highlight the tile you're in.
Gameplay:
Where are my demons at?
Consider having the penalties be less (or more!) harsh depending on whether submitting is voluntary or not; IMVHO, there's a big difference between voluntarily saying "All right, I give in" and fighting to the last.
Will there be a toyshop, so you can voluntarily stretch out your throat or whatever without having to find a horsie, and then submit?
Will there be more advanced "testing"?

	Huge memory leak.

	The map isn't appearing for some of you. I'd advise getting the most up-to-date version of Java, as this might fix that problem. I'm using JavaFX for the GUI, and I noticed on my other computer that some of the UI elements weren't rendering when I was using an older version of Java. I'll also investigate this problem further in case it isn't related to the Java version (as it's a pretty major bug not being able to see the map!).
	
	If you get a 'Java Exception', it could be several things. I'm going to add a crash report feature to the engine soon which will show exactly what's gone wrong (I'm thinking of having it create a crash report text file which you could then copy-paste here).
	
	The save game window isn't opening. Again, I'll investigate this!
	
	Thread spawning & high memory usage
	Feedback on UI (everything should be accessable with mouse, I struggled to create a keyboard-friendly inventory management system)
	Minimap - UI scaling is a bit wonky at the moment, I plan to improve the UI a lot more
	Random game crashes - I'll implement the crash report feature soon!


	CONSIDER: Corruption mechanics need to unlock stuff.

	Fetishes:
		Ask Lilaya about never needing to use the toilet.
		She points out that you haven't drunk or eaten anything since arriving (bar TF consumables).
		You don't need to eat or drink in this world, as the arcane gives energy to people.
	Waterworks:
		She asks if you'd like to test out a drink she's made.
		It activates waterworks fetish.
		Your bladder fills up as a status effect. When full, you have 10 minutes to reach a bathroom or else you wet yourself.
		Negative status effect if clothes are covered in urine.
		During sex, you can wet yourself.
		You can bring 5 dry squeeze to Lilaya to stop it.
	Weight:
		She asks if you'd like to test out a chocolate bar she's made.
		It activates weight fetish.
		You get chubby.
		The chocolate bar has 5 uses, each one making you fatter.
		You can go see Pix to get rid of it.

	- Level 2 freezing opaque deamonstone seems to cast slam instead of ice shard. The chill effect is still triggered though.
- The option menu does not work from the inventory : you are forced to go on another menu before.
- Wearing too masculine clothing when you have a feminine body does not seem to trigger any stat reduction like it would do with a male wearing too feminine clothing (intended ?). However, it does trigger and remain once you had non-consensual sex (lose a fight).

That's all I could find for now.

I would also suggest the following addition :

- Fire element seems to be obviously stronger than other elements so far due to its additional damage effect. I think the additional effect from poison and ice should also be buffed in order to make all elements a bit more balanced.
- Poison Shield and Ice Shield are not only useless at the moment due to the lack of poison and ice damage : they also look underwhelming. I suggest to make the poison shield deal poison damage to melee attackers and ice shield to reduce stamina/willpower of melee attackers.
- Stamina does not seem to have any purpose in combat right now : it's just used at the gym. I suggest to make spells drain stamina instead of willpower. It would give more sense to the chill effect as well, preventing the enemy from using their skills too much.
	
	
	Add in race & item discovery quests (bottom of character creation dialogue class).
	
	- Fix descriptions in inventory 
	
	- Refine selfie.
	
	- Fix all RacialBody parts to use parts specific to their race

	-TODO Items:
	
		- Add corruption gains!
		
		- Multiple: Transformative items for race
			- Milked from demon's factories in the desert district (this is not common knowledge)
			- Demons have corrupted futa milking cows for each race, and combine their own cum with with their sexual fluids, using magic to make them transformative.
			- All transformative crystals should follow the theme of "crystal-strength-name animal-hint" e.g. "lesser crystal of the lupine howl"
		
		- Potions that temporarily increase attributes, following naming theme "potion-strength-name of attribute-theme" e.g. "elixir of strength" or "draught of iron-skin"
		- Food, magic-shots & drink. Generic and racial-specific. Generic provides minor + for each resource. Racial provides +++ for each resource based on transformation stage.
			(Magic shots are small crystals that you break open. The magic regenerates your mind. Sort of like drugs, but no addictive properties.)
	
	- redo crop tops
	
	- Incorporate help into options
	
	- Inventory needs polish (remove items from populated areas, text descriptions a little bit off here and there)
	
	-TODO All encounters in Dominion sketched out.

	5)  Finish sex class
		Refine arousal gains from all actions.
		Go through all TODO in Sex class and fix them.
		
		KEEP THE DESCRIPTIONS DOWN TO 1 OR 2 SENTENCES FOR COMMON ACTIONS.
		Long descriptions soon become a chore to read and take up a lot of screen space. Keep them short and sweet.
		For penetration you can make descriptions longer.
		
		In sex actions, if player/partner is ready to penetrate, change "do nothing" to "prevent penetration"
		
		TODO Lose health if being stretched. Loses more health the bigger the cock. Reduces health loss if lubed.
		If you get to 0 health, you can use composure to hold on, if you don't, or are at 0 composure, you pass out and gain a lot of corruption
		(if you are dom, they pass out into misionary and you can fuck their passed out body)
		You wake up later and applies stretch mechanics as though you were fully stretched to his size
		
		Need specific descriptions of continuing penetration (e.g. doggy says how tits are swaying with each thrust)
		
		Finish SexManager
		
		Masturbation, Foreplay, Missionary, Doggy & against wall for repeatable NPCs at release
		Specific ones for Vicky and story lines
		
		Pull out options
		
		COMBINE MASTURBATION INTO SEX
		
		//TODO drop player clothes on floor after sex if was sub.
		// If player resists when partner is taking their clothes off, partner rips them off
		
		Make playerSexualCry() occur when arousal is over 50
		Make PlayerSexTalk into a class that is created for AbstractCharacters, so can for npc and player. Things to say when being penetrated/penetrating/neither:
		Sub and resisting
		Sub and accepting
		Dom and you are resisting
		Dom and you are submitting
		Player can define custom lines in character screen.
		
		Masturbation placeholder for all types
		Add racial-flavour text & unique bodyPart descriptors (imagine being partnered with one of your race)
		
		Also do this for transformations.
		Polish all transformation descriptions.
		Don't lose stats from transformation stats
		
		
		--------------------------------------
		
		Before you do the next part, go through races and make sure 100% that is what you want them to be like.
		
		Add imps (don't worry about Lilin and Alpha Imp yet)
		
		Harpy male descriptions (they look like females but with more colourful feathers, male harpies get treated like dirt and are constantly humiliated because they aren't as attractive as the females)
		Change Tengu to be more aggressive versions of harpies (harpy flock is owned by a femlae tengu who will have a male tengu as her personal bitch)
		Harpy matriarchal society
		
		THEN:
		
		Go through all body part setters and put in generic descriptions for NPCs. Then can use these as a base for player transformation descriptions.
		
		
		
		
		In scenes, give a button to "examine scene" which gives a brief sentence about what's going on and describes all important characters

		SetContent, when text is longer than the displayed page, causes flickering if not at bottom of page when going back/pressing 0. It puts page to bottom, then goes back.
		But not when going back???
		Javascript seems to be putting scrollbar to bottom, THEN going to next dialogueNode
		
		Alcohol items.
		Give player an alcohol int that degrades over time. Give status effects when get tipsy, drunk, hammered which reduce maximum composure.
		Give bonus physical strength. Reduce dodge and hit chance.
		Make a speech parser for drunk speech
		
		Make level-up perks
		The more corrupted you get, the harder it is to resist demon's commands (resisting costs willpower). At 100, you will do anything they command you to. At higher levels, it takes more willpower to resist demands.

 	 	They like to grow their cocks/breasts to the same size as a normal demon, making it a bit extreme on their smaller frames.
